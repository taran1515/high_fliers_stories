He built his first computer program on the General Electric machine. Gates met Paul Allen at the school and they worked together to find bugs in the PDP-10 system belonging to Computer Center Corporation.

In 1975 the MITS Altair 8800 based on Intelâ€™s 8080 CPU was released. Bill and Paul saw this as an opportunity to start their own software company.
